dns-forward-max=5096 # This increases the max DNS forward limit, for busy internal network . Default limit is 150.... 1024+ is more realistic.
#min-cache-ttl=300 # This extends the minimum time-to-live settings for cached lookups and ensures all DNS lookups will be cached for at least 300 seconds. This is a very useful setting to take full advantage of caching nameserver capabilities.
rebind-domain-ok= # Allows specific domains where DNS rebind support is needed.
